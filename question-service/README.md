## Setup Question Service
Ensure your current working directory is the `question-service` folder.
```
npm install --global yarn
yarn install
yarn run dev
```
This project uses NodeJS version v18.16.1 and `yarn` version 1.22.19.


### Setting up MongoDB
1. Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)
1. Create a `question-service` database
1. Create a `questions` collection
1. Create a `counters` collection and insert the following document:
    ```
    {
        "collectionName": "questions",
        "sequenceNum": 1
    }
    ```

1. Lastly, create a file called `.env` in the `question-service` folder and add the following lines to it:
    ```
    ENV=DEV
    local_db_url=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/question-service
    question_collection_name=questions
    counter_collection_name=counters
    ```

    MongoDB uses the default IP address and port number of `127.0.0.1:27017`. Change these values accordingly if your MongoDB installation uses otherwise. Note that newer versions of NodeJS may not resolve the keyword `localhost` properly, so it is best to use `127.0.0.1` to explicitly refer to your local machine.


## Testing API
To test the API, you may use Postman or the Rest Client Extension within VSCode.

### REST Client Extension Installation
1. Open Visual Studio Code.

1. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.

1. Search for "REST Client" in the Extensions Marketplace.

1. Click the Install button for the "REST Client" extension by Huachao Mao.

1. Once the installation is complete, you can access the extension from the Extensions view or the integrated terminal.

### Sending Requests
In the `route.rest` file, place the cursor anywhere in the request block and use the "Send Request" button on top of the block or you can right click anywhere in the request block and select "Send Request".


## Sample Data
The following is some sample data you can use to test the API:
```
{
    "title": "Reverse a String",
    "categories": ["Strings", "Algorithms"],
    "complexity": "easy",
    "description": "Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.",
    "link": "https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/"
}
```

```
{
  "title": "Implement Stack using Queues",
  "categories": ["Stack", "Queue"],
  "complexity": "medium",
  "description": "Implement a stack using the standard library queue data structure.",
  "link": "https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/"
}
```
