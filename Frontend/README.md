This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Setup
1. Git clone the repository
2. Navigate to the `Server` directory and run `npm install`
3. Run `node server.js` to start up the signaling server
4. Run `ngrok` with the following command `ngrok tcp 4444`, make sure you have ngrok installed
5. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies, make sure you're in the `Frontend` directory
6. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
