# Assignment 1 Instructions

## Services

### Frontend

Create a .env file in the root directory of the Frontend folder. Refer to .env.sample for the environment variables required for the frontend to run. Questions will be fetched from a hosted database and displayed on the frontend.

## Prerequisites

-   NodeJS version >v18
-   Ensure .env is cloned in the Frontend folder. You may refer to .env.sample. The .env file contains the environment variables required for the services to run. Ideally, the .env file should not be committed to the repository as it contains sensitive information but we have left the environment variables in the .env.sample file for your convenience.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this branch
2. Install the dependencies for each service by running `yarn install` in the respective service folders for Frontend
3. Open separate terminals for each service and run the following commands:
    - Frontend: `yarn build` followed by `yarn start`
